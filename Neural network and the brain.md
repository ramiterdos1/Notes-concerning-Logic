Neural network and the brain

---


### Broad Topic
[[Artificial intelligence]]

## Subtopic
[[computation]] by neural networks in contrast to human brains


## Exact Question

What makes neural networks different from our actual brain neuron networks?

### Preliminary thoughts

1.  our brain uses the same architecture which is somewhat -evolvable \[ this can be taken care of in a finite artificial neural network\] and a same neuron might be engaged in different tasks in a sense the functions domain ranges \[contexts\] are different. And somehow our brain can create new "function mappings" by understanding the similarity or dissimilarity among the two functions ( this happens for another n-many functions actually - each task that a human does in its everyday life ). The idea of "creation" is actually something like a bug /runaway code from the perspective of the neural network architecture. From the perspective of ANN's suddenly creating a new ordered pair which is different from the ordered pairs fed into its system as test data is absurd and it will also reject such instances of the problem. In a sense our brains do not have a definition of what problem it wants to solve, but it does solve the problem of walking/eating/playing a sport/solving a math problem.. but what is the overall problem it is solving it doesn't know and therefore anything can _linked_ to another.
2.  [[Artificial intelligence]] relies on `signals` like text,video,sound,image and has developed algorithms around it. Humans can do [[proprioception]] something that machines will find hard to do.
3.  As many different ways we have towards internalising a concept the closer we are to understanding the concept. [blind men and the elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant)
4. Need to generalise but after going through specificity. From the mess of specifics to getting the real structure via abstraction is key to how human brains do [[computation]].
5.  Spaced or interleaved learning is a way to gain access to information much better.
