## Topic
I have a strange uneasiness when it comes to proving the logical formulas capture the semantic idea we want to "capture". 

Psychologically it feel like it is obvious and I just become dumbstruck as to what or how do I even start proving, perhaps I will go about writing the same words expressing the formulas. I do not have this problem in say when I am doing proofs of something that is culturally considered "maths", I have tried to replicate the cmi first years course in this phd training by doing first course algebra, analysis, point set topology problems by myself, and somehow I find myself more comfortable there. 

I had similar problems with say **algorithms**. Once the algorithm is written down it felt like it's obvious and I was baffled about how do I even start to prove the syntactical algorithm captures the semantical world of graphs etc. I have worked at it and I am way more comfortable there .

I have to figure out how to get better here and think more rationally to get this done.
